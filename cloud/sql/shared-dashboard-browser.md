This snippet can be used with SQL Analytics to format the response from SquaredUp's API `openaccess/shares` endpoint to make a tile of clickable blocks that represent shared dashboards. Works as a nice browser / directory.

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN "properties.requireAuthentication" = true THEN CONCAT("dashboardName", ' üîê')
        ELSE "dashboardName"
    END AS label,
    "workspaceName" AS sublabel,
    CASE
        WHEN "properties.enabled" = true THEN 'success'
        ELSE 'unknown'
    END AS state,
    CONCAT('http://app.squaredup.com/openaccess/', SUBSTRING("id", 9)) AS link
FROM dataset1
--- the following line can be used to filter out dashboards by workspace
--- or just remove it if you don't need to filter anything
WHERE "workspaceName" NOT IN ('Workspace-1', 'Workspace-2')
```
